        txt1:'APPUDO is a platform for intelligent execution, management and especially creation of programs in a distributed multi user environment. With APPUDO it is possible to orchestrate program pieces and scale better than monolithic programs or microservices.',
        txt2:'As a thin layer on top of the linux kernel you can install it on mostly any AARCH64 or AMD64 machine with a single package.',
        txt3:'Your machine then becomes a Node of the system that is controllable through a common platform interface.',
        txt4:'The Node is still owned by you with full control what runs on it.',
        txt5:'This makes APPUDO a most extensible platform that can potentially serve any use case.',
        txt6:'At the same time a Node can run on its own, in fact the platform interface itself is a packaged Dash to run on any Node.',       
        h1:'Node',
        txt7:'A single Machine running APPUDO is called a Node.',
        h2:'Dash',
        txt8:'A Node can host multiple Dashs. They are like Accounts containing Ressources and can be packaged for Node placement.',
        h3:'Run',
        txt9:'A Dash can consist of multiple Runs which define Code Entry Points of various kinds like Webpages or WebSocket Listeners.',
